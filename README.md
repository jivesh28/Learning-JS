# Learning-JS
i started learning Js a long time ago(int 2k23) but i was unaware of the fact that sharing it on github would be great for me and my peers , i learned it from Chai and code and read the MDN documentation .
realized that reading documentation is boring but is extremely necessary 
documentations really help in understanding the behind scenes of any language
